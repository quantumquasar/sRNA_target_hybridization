Small-RNA target prediction by leveraging RNA hybridization using sequences from pulse and MAPS techniques in *Salmonella*. Sequences are filtered and passed through *IntaRNA* to predict hybridization models for the sRNA *PinT*. The minimum free energy (MFE) values are afterwards used to calculate the p-values.
